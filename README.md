I just put together a webpage of random content.  

View webpage by launching the index.html file.

Active link in the header opens webpage in another tab.

Page and content are responsive to all screen sizes.

I added two javascript functions:

Clicking anywhere on the background randomly changes the background color.

Clicking "submit" & "reset" prompts a js alert.
